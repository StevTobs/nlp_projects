Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.</td>\n",

I ordered the Salt and Vinegar and absolutely love that flavor, hands down my favorite chip ever.  I have tried the cheddar and regular flavors as well.  The cheddar is about a 4/5 and the regular is about a 3/5 because I prefer strong flavors and obviously that would not be the case for the regular.  The Salt and Vinegar is kind of weak compared to some regular S&V chips, but is quite flavorful and makes you wanting to come back for more.   \n",

I was always a big fan of potato chips, but haven't had one since I discovered popchips.  They are great for dipping or all alone.  I am constantly re-ordering them.  One note however-if you are on a low salt diet these chips are probably not for you. They are high in sodium.  We go through a case every two months.  If you love them it pays to join the subscribe and save program through Amazon.  You save money and stay supplied!   \n",

They were the bomb then, not so much now.  Won't buy again unless I get them for cheap or free.   \n",

They look almost like a flattened rice cake, but taste so much better, more like a potato chip. The bbq flavor is delicious. They are very low in fat and full of flavor.

       "559  I love potato chips.  I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.   \n",

The price was always great and these really are my go-to snack.  They are always fresh and delicious from Amazon.<br /><br />I definitely prefer Original over barbecue and sour cream & onion.  I haven't tried other flavors, but Original works just fine for me because I use it for various dips and will even use dry seasonings on them if I'm in the mood.<br /><br />I don't know anybody that I've offered some of these to who didn't want a bag of their own!  Highly recommended.   \n",
